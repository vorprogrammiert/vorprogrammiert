# Hi there, I'm Sebastian

I'm a **Chemical Laboratory Technician** with a passion for coding. My journey into tech started with data analysis and has evolved into a deep fascination with **Artificial Intelligence**.

Beyond AI, I'm also starting as **solo game developer**, handling everything from programming to creating the graphics, animations, and music.

### My YouTube Channel: Learning in Public

I believe to share my learning process will motivate me to go on. My YouTube channel is where I'll document these process.

No videos yet, (have to manage the "Impressumspflicht",) but I will note it here if that changes.
