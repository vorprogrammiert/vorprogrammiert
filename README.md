### My YouTube Channel: Learning in Public

I believe to share my learning process will motivate me to go on. My YouTube channel is where I'll document these process.

No videos yet, (have to manage the "Impressumspflicht",) but I will note it here if that changes.

### My Philosophy & Tech Stack

I prefere **Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)** and strive to use them for almost everything. The one notable exception is [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/). As a Digital Audio Workstation, its flexibility, developer-friendly pricing, and scripting capabilities have earned it a permanent place in my creative toolkit.

- **OS:** `Linux (Debian + KDE Plasma)`
- **Core Interests:** `AI`, `Solo Game Development`, `Data Science`, `Multimedia Creation`
- **Languages:** `Python`, `Bash`
- **Development & Editing:** `Zed`, `Jupyter Lab`
