# Hi there, I'm Sebastian

I'm a **Chemical Laboratory Technician** with a passion for building thingsâ€”both in the lab and in the code editor. My journey into tech started with data analysis and has evolved into a deep fascination with **Artificial Intelligence** (I'm currently experimenting with LangChain, DSPy, and Ollama).

Beyond AI, I'm also starting as **solo game developer**, handling everything from programming to creating the graphics, animations, and music.

### My YouTube Channel: Learning in Public

I believe to share my learning process will motivate me to go on. My YouTube channel is where I'll document these process. Expect to see:
- **AI Experiments:** Practical projects and explorations with the latest tools.
- **Solo Devlogs:** Watch me build games from scratch, including all the creative steps.
- **FOSS & Linux:** A focus on doing high-quality work with open-source tools on a Linux environment.

### My Philosophy & Tech Stack

As a **Linux fanboy (Debian + KDE Plasma)** I prefere **Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)**. I believe in community-driven tools and strive to use them for almost everything. The one notable exception is Reaper. As a Digital Audio Workstation, its incredible power, flexibility, and developer-friendly pricing have earned it a permanent place in my creative toolkit.

- **OS:** `Linux (Debian testing)`
- **Core Interests:** `AI`, `Solo Game Development`, `Data Science`, `Multimedia Creation`
- **Languages:** `Python`
- **AI & Data Science:** `LangChain`, `DSPy`, `Ollama`, `scikit-learn`
- **Creative Suite:**
  - **Graphics & Animation:** `GIMP`, `Krita`, `Inkscape`, `Blender`
  - **Audio:** `Reaper` (my one cherished exception!), `Ocenaudio`
- **Development & Editing:** `Git`, `GitHub`, `Kate`, `Jupyter Lab`
